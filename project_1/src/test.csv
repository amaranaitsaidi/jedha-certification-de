I was dancing the whole night and it stayed in place on my head with the clips. The rhinestones were beautiful and not cheaply made. Amazing product.;99.15729857085311

5;269;1;1;Premium Beauty;0.9880593620427125;1;0.9605;Love this shampoo and conditioner. Have tried Wen, Function of Beauty, Chi and other major brands. Still come back to this one.

5;355;1;1;All Beauty;0.9628934664913628;1;0.97565;Pretty impressed! To be safe I wiped the tint off before the suggested time was up. I had to touch up a few spots that needed additional darkening. Its easy to mix and apply. If youre on the fence i totally reccomend. Easier than applying brow powder every day and was less expensive than my bi-weekly trips to brow spa for tinting. Totally worth the buy!;98.27805399474089
5;336;1;1;All Beauty;0.9839305142725083;1;0.94375;Amazing for eyebrows!!! Mine were white blonde as you can see in the pic.

During the summer my hair gets pretty light but it’s naturally dark. The last time I mixed a capsule to tint mine, I was able to tint two of my friend’s eyebrows as well. It goes a long ways.;97.6696592975499
5;378;1;1;All Beauty;0.9267698669075553;1;0.9412499999999999;This is the dark brown. I left it in over 6 minutes ( 4 recommended) ..I forgot! Soooo it was a little too dark. However, it's easy to use. I did remove some of the color initially, but it's pretty much set now. Can't answer how long it lasts as this is my first experience with this brand  color comes in capsule, separate developer, and a brush with a little cup. Easy, peasy!;96.33434600722666

I love that its collapsible saving me space and I actually collapse one level to get air closer to the scalp to dry it faster, it fits my drier perfectly so air doesnt scape, it doesn't over heat either, I could go on for a while. I will be returning my old expensive diffuser to the store and keeping my Curly Co. Thank you for this great product!;80.19664640495554

5;600;1;1;All Beauty;0.32465246735834974;1;0.9924999999999999;I LOVE this stuff! I was blessed with nice  eyebrows, but I like mine to look bold and thick. This saves me from having to fill them in every morning! You’ll have to experiment how long you want to leave on the tint for how dark you want it. The directions recommend 3-4 minutes but I leave it on for 12ish. Even still, it leaves my brows looking full but still natural. One capsule can last me 2-3 fills so really this is a fantastic deal (especially since my salon charges $10 an application for the exact sane result!)  I usually reapply every week. It’s very simple to use and I love the results.;79.55207402075048

These clothes are coarse so gentle scrubbing is enough to remove rough spots.  It’s also long enough that you can easily scrub your back.  They do not easily fall apart/unravel like loofahs plus you can launder them.  Highly recommend.;79.43715929754988

They're a good length so it's easy to wash your back.  I like these for the exfoliating, but also because the nylon dries so much quicker than a cloth washcloth, which is especially nice if you live in a humid environment.;77.66889686838033

5;373;0;1;All Beauty;0.9355576596990668;1;0.9245;Excellent Product.  This is way better than I expected.  It is thick when mixed. Covered really well, and pay attention to the recommended time. I used on my eyebrows and they were colored really quick, even the stubborn few gray hairs.  I used dark brown, and that turned out almost black.  I think I will buy a lighter color for next time.  Highly recommend this product.;76.179229790972

We are lucky that those little plastic crowns can only live with my 3-year-old child for a week. Therefore, I decided to ""invest"" in a more robust product, and I am glad I did it! When she saw it, my little child screamed and then jumped around excitedly! She even wanted to wear it to sleep last night, haha!";76.17490707753787

You have to put it on carefully and find your comfort level. I bought this an almost 4 yo and though she liked it, it wasn’t something she wanted to grab. I had to help her each time. So if you buy this, be aware it’s more of an older child/adult item.;76.09959383693771

5;230;0;1;All Beauty;0.9405880633643421;1;0.8632;I am very pleased with the washcloths.  I was replacing an old one for myself and gave one as a gift.  The product was exactly as advertised and was delivered one day earlier than expected.  I will purchase from this seller again.;74.79764190093027
5;422;0;1;All Beauty;0.8302320823400083;1;0.99405;This is holy grail. I bought one for my mom, dad, brother, best friend, neighbor. Errrrbody gets one. Feel so good on my body. This has been a dream for my in grown hair. Seriously I’ve tried every single body scrub, nothing has helped. I feel like my body goes through an amazing massage every time I shower. The product itself is so perfect for getting the upper and lower back cleaned too. Love love love. Will reorder.;74.75821247020026
1;293;0;1;All Beauty;0.9993876875398336;1;0.7891;This product was very drying. It's nothing like the discription on the bottle. I understand sulfates, but my hair became very tangled and drying. I asked a friend with different hair texture and the experienced the same thing. Also, keep in mind different hair textures will react differently.;74.709130626195
1;291;0;1;All Beauty;0.9989880124051737;1;0.78945;I saw continuous and thought yay this is what I’ve been looking for. And yeah it’s not continuous. Which really is the only reason I wanted it. It’s small and doesn’t hold much water. The spray portion is bigger than the water reservoir. Maybe it’s good for plants but not for anything else.;74.70589037215521
1;200;0;1;All Beauty;0.8824969025845955;1;0.9290499999999999;It looks really nice. That’s about it. The the mirror and metal manual calculus remover that it comes with are better than the device itself. Doesn’t really work — save your money and go to a dentist.;74.70115707753786
5;422;0;1;All Beauty;0.8302320823400083;1;0.98865;I'll buy these forever. They dry incredibly fast and lather soap really well. I don't go through bars of soap or body wash as quickly as I used to. It's rough on the skin, but it's like someone giving you an awesome back scratching. The fact that they dry quickly is my favorite selling point. It's not gross like a loofa. I use these for my morning shower at the gym and I hate lugging around anything wet. Great product.;74.62321247020026
5;191;0;1;All Beauty;0.8619892322377526;1;0.9497;I am impressed!  My daughter refuses to go to the dentist because of sensory issues and anxiety!  This item has been a God send for us!  I am super excited!  She has already started using it!;74.60217696713258
5;190;0;1;All Beauty;0.8596327636025423;1;0.952;Been using these types of wash cloth all my life. I love these defiantly not for some may find it rough, but I enjoy the exfoliation. Very good product does exactly what it is suppose to do.;74.58898290807628

5;183;0;1;All Beauty;0.8427267613778846;1;0.96955;This dental calculus remover was very easy to use and holds a good charge! It offers several cleaning modes for your comfort level which I like. I'd definitely recommend this product.;74.52055284133654

5;407;0;1;All Beauty;0.8666565645474607;1;0.9365;Sometimes you just produce more tartar than others and that’s ok. Meds you take can affect your oral health and even produce more tartar than your average person. This is great tool for in between dentist visits to keep your teeth looking and feeling great. My meds do make me produce more tartar buildup and I was always self conscious about it, but this has really helped my self esteem! Highly recommend.;74.41219693642383
5;232;0;1;All Beauty;0.9438386963005431;1;0.8426;These cloths are very rough and that is what I was looking for. Definitely not something you want to use on your face but great for the rest of your body. Really gets the dead skin off and leaves your body tingling and feeling good.;74.3801608890163
5;205;0;1;All Beauty;0.8933181415656826;1;0.9008;These are the super scrubby type of these wash clothes, I like that but if you have sensitive skin beware! Nice to get a 3-pack so you can put one in the shower, the gym bag and the travel kit (for trips).;74.31954424697047
5;183;0;1;All Beauty;0.8427267613778846;1;0.9608;"Love these - great for exfoliating.  Start out rough, but are perfect for a &#34;brisk&#34; exfoliating wash after a couple uses.  Last a long time without becoming pathetically soft.";74.30180284133654
5;420;0;1;All Beauty;0.835270211411272;1;0.9693499999999999;I just got mine and ran to test it as soon as it arrived. Yep, it works! I didn’t spend enough time, only about 10 mins, and I’ll have to go back, but dang I’m happy with what it did in 10 mins! It took me about 2 mins playing with the angle and speed. The bottom teeth are more difficult for me to get a correct angle, so I’ll need more practice. Definitely impressed though. I’ve never run to write a review this fast!;74.29185634233816
5;204;0;1;All Beauty;0.8911878885041844;1;0.9018999999999999;I bought the first one for misting my curly hair. I’ve never used anything that worked so well, with so little effort. Then I bought the second one to mist my hanging plants in the heat. They love it too!;74.28313665512553
5;186;0;1;All Beauty;0.8500585920924473;1;0.9512;These things are AMAZING. i will never use anything else. It really lathers and exfoliates without irritating you. This is the second time i purchase. Great buy. You wont be dissapointed;74.28175776277342
5;412;0;1;All Beauty;0.8548750167246695;1;0.9447;Ok, so this is the best random product I have tried for filling in and darling brows, I over plucked in my teen years and as a adult have been growing them back but there’s spots that just don’t grow well, I have had my brows Microbladed even!! And that didn’t last at all... this product is a temp product but for me it’s worth it to re “dye” them as needed instead of having to fill them in daily with make up.;74.26375050174009

1;416;0;1;All Beauty;0.8451847808236714;1;0.9460999999999999;This was simply too unwieldy and large for my purposes. The folding design is convenient but it comes at a price: constantly readjusting it because it collapses on itself while you're using it.<br /><br />I can see it being useful for some people (and worth the trouble), but it's not for me. To be clear, this product came exactly as described and is of good quality, it just has some minor flaws I can't deal with.;74.00804342471015

I especially like that it removes the debris under my arm pits caused by my deodorant and also saves on bath gel costs because you don't need to use a lot to work up a good lather. I don't travel anywhere without my cloth...absolutely love it!;73.94297176010174

I personally feel that, in terms of make-up, your eyebrows shape your face. So I was always insecure about the fact that mine, naturally speaking, were so blonde you couldn't even see them! So I tried dyes of all kinds (most of which I had horrible allergic reactions to and burns on my face) - I even got them professionally done! But I just tried the dark brown Godefroy dye and it's easily the best dye I have ever used. I will forever<br />be using this product. Thank you so much!

So I put it on for 3 minutes and then rubbed off. I kept repeating this until I got what I wanted. Use petroleum jelly in order to prevent from dying skin around eyebrow. It stings only because I was rubbing off and drying my brows between each time I put the dye on.

I could smell it when I got home on him and it smelled wonderful.  It left his hair soft and nice looking.<br />I used it the next morning on my hair.  I have long hair that is bleached, dry and frizzy at times.  First of all, I like the pump so I can easily get the amount I need and no need to open a lid and close.  I used more than the recommended pea size amount, because I have alot of hair.  It does not suds very much, but I believe that is because it is sulfate free.  So that is a good thing.  :)  I used only the shampoo, no conditioner afterwards.  I let my hair dry naturally.  I straightened as normal and you can see a picture below.

I lost a huge amount of my hair last year and Argan oil helped me grow it back. and not only grow long but it made my hair grow healthy. I love using natural products specially on my hair as im just tryung to get them all back into long curly hair. and believe me it has grown a lot ever since i use it. its natural ingredients wont harm your hair like other chemical shampoo in the market. Depends on your hair type but mine is very thin. It cannot handle too much weight as it add to getting hair loss. I always wash my hair everyday but i dont use the shampoo everyday. yes its safe to use on a daily basis but i just choose not to. I use argan oil shampoo and conditioner. after that i put agran oil and leave it on my hair. now when im going somewhere that i need to get my hair done i always put argan hair mask before i shower and then rinse it after 10 mins. it will make your hair more manageable. What I like about this brand specifically is that it doesn't only come with Argan oil.

5;477;0;1;Premium Beauty;0.6759660000419371;1;0.97275;I ordered this December of last year and as of writing this review I ran out, so hopefully that gives you a perspective of its price point. I’ve tried other brands like OGX and their thickening feels temporary. With this, it will feel temporary for a bit but after months of using it, my hair truly felt more thick. I had to use a different shampoo since I ran out of it and my hair instantly went thin and didn’t feel the same, so I definitely recommend getting their product.;69.59773000125811

5;1159;1;1;All Beauty;9.869142448006385e-05;1;0.9799;This product was exactly what I was looking for! I have very blonde and sparse eyebrows & needed them to be darker. With this tint, I can make them any shape I want and it lasts for 1-2 weeks depending on how long I leave it on. I usually leave it on for about 5 minutes. It does stain your skin, but comes off after a couple of days of washing your face. Also, before applying, I would highly recommend washing your face, and do NOT apply any moisturizer immediately before or after application. If you do, your eyebrows could potentially turn a different color. I made the dumb mistake of applying a tinting lotion on right after using this and my eyebrows turned orange. Lol.. however, as long as you use common sense, this is a great product and I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants darker eyebrows!<br />**Update**  I added a photo for product reference.  It's still my favorite and one box has lasted several months!  It even holds up in the pool!  During sunny weather I do 2 applications for a darker effect.  Just DON'T leave it on any longer than 5-10 minutes,  otherwise it looks splotchy.  Does make getting ready soooo much faster!;69.50046074273439

Eyebrows with product- let is sit for 10 mins<br />3. Removed color with face wash & water<br />4. Removed the stain skin color with skin color remover from Sally's ($4 for a small- lasts about a year)<br /><br />There wasn't that much of a vast different. It did color all my baby hairs just fine. Instructions recommend leaving it on for 2 mins. That would've done nothing. Next time I plan on leaving it for 20 mins. It stains your skin pretty bad. I highly, highly recommend going to Sally's and buying hair color remover first. It removes the color from the skin only. Otherwise you'll look like you have insane tattooed brows.<br /><br />I also added some on my lashes by the lash line, my eyes started to burn in about 5 mins. That's when I took it off. Don't recommend it, but it did leave some good color.<br /><br />Also, I recommend getting a few people together. The amount of color one capsule produces is good enough for maybe 8 pairs of eyebrows. But probably not enough to cover an entire mans beard.;69.29424993063083

I was skeptical about this product before i used it. The first time i used it, my mind was blown out. I felt i had never been this clean since maybe 2010. When u first use it, it does feel a bit scratchy, but the results are that your skin will feel silky and clean, and Tbh the scratchy feeling is very satisfying as well. I do recommend you buy it,  but don't use it every day, i now use it once a week and i find this frequency is right for me.;64.06186516977262

I have used it exclusively for about two weeks and noticed my hair is nice and soft. The bottle is pretty big and offers a good amount. One pump is enough for my hair which is past my shoulder blades. It also comes in a bottle that does look classy and is nice to have in a guest bathroom. The lather is nice and it washes out quickly. My only criticism is that the smell isn't as... Gentle as I hoped. When you see Argan oil products, you expect that vanilla esque scent. This doesn't have that, it is more soapy.

After washing them off I was VERY pleased! They look just like I filled my brows in with my usual Anastasia dark brown brow pomade. But the best part is that it won't come off at the end of the day.

I have debated microblading my eyebrows since they're thin and light, but I like a more natural look. I've been using this product in dark brown for a few years with great results. I like a darker brow with blond hair and this turns my eyebrows a nice medium brown after a 10-minute application. As others have said, be careful about getting this on your skin as it's stubborn to get off. After a lot of practice, I don't need to use vaseline or anything to keep the dye in place, though. I re-dye my brows about once a month.;59.40752450617231

I tried to use it on my daughter but she says it hurts, so it's back to wash cloths as after reading an article on loofahs, those will never be in my house every again. This dries well and it's perfect for your back without having to buy a different bath item.;59.370054432785516

Not only will these exfoliate your skin more than loofahs, but you can toss em in the washer and keep using them pretty much till they tear. I used to have little bumps all over my upper arms (there's a name for this skin condition but I can't remember now), and these totally smoothed them away. surprisingly, I also like them for exfoliating my face/lips on occasion, and they seem to help exfoliate stretch marks too. Overall a 10/10 for me, I will buy these forever.;59.19377450617232

5;592;0;1;All Beauty;0.344452182766909;1;0.94225;I've used these cloths for many years - long before Amazon carried them. I had a friend visit the Japanese market in Costa Mesa to get them for me. Thankfully I no longer have to pester her. Imagine my happiness finding out a couple years ago that Amazon now carried them. They're nice and exfoliating. I have to have a rougher wash cloth or I don't feel clean (but it's too rough on my face). They never mold so I have to remind myself to switch them out yearly (they seem to get a bit less scrubby as the years go by). Three cloths last three years for me. I'll never use anything else now.;58.88981548300727

I have medium brown eye brows and it darkened them up perfectly. It definitely colors quick, so if you’re like me and have never dyed any hair yourself, I would suggest doing one brow at a time and timing it. That’s what helped me keep the colors even. I suggest also getting a qtip, ideally with vaseline, to clean up the edges immediately after applying the color, as it does leave a bit of a color stain on the skin for a couple days.

After extensive research for another all natural shampoo, I came across this and saw that everyone raved about it so I decided to give it a try. I LOVE that it is only made up of natural oils. I have long curly hair and after I use this my curls are defined and shiny. I use a natural conditioner after I shampoo my hair but only a little bit since it doesn't really feel like it needs it.

I use a waterpic, sonic toothbrush, floss AND I use a rinse for cavities. After having a failed root canal resulting in an implant that cost far more than a family vacation to Greece.....I take impeccable care of my teeth . This for me is the final step for those areas that you can't reach with floss or the toothbrush. I can tell a huge difference...but mostly ? It is gentle.

I will say that I think it's meant to remove more severe tartar build-up. My teeth are in pretty good shape and I only got it since I've had to skip dental appointments due to the pandemic. So for me, the sonic dental calculus remover was helpful at loosening the little plaque buildup I had with the vibrations. Then, I used the other metal calculus remover tool to remove the loosened plaque. I follow up with a flouride polish to clean any residual plaque and to protect my teeth.

That is the only positive think I can say about this shampoo.  I feel it strips my hair and leaves it flat and lifeless.  My scalp is not rejuvenate.  Instead it feels dry and itchy at times.<br /><br />It smells on the chemical side and I certainly don’t smell any notes of “natural vanilla and sumptuous honey.”  I was expecting an at least pleasant scent.  The bottles says “No Harsh Chemicals” but there are ingredients I can barely pronounce – Acyl Sarcosine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosine and what the heck is GRECAT BTMS-350???<br /><br />It comes in a generous size pump style bottle that will last you a while.

5;706;0;1;All Beauty;0.12739662851114705;1;0.969;This product is definitely darker than I expected. My hair is a very dark brown often mistaken for black, and it's almost too dark for me to pull off. Granted, I do leave it on for 30 minutes because otherwise the color looks more green on my skin. It might just be my undertone, though, so don't let that deter you. I'm ordering the lighter brown to mix in with this color to see if it's a better match with a 1/4 ratio since it seems more red based.<br /><br />If you already have thick (dense) brows and are trying to groom them back into the right shape after a mishap, this product is a great tool! It also works well with masking the scar at the top of one of my brow arches. So glad I gave it a try.;53.04689885533441

The purpose of my review is to express my complete satisfaction with Meeteasy's customer service. The Meeteasy Dental Cleaner Tool Kit was missing the charging cord. I contacted the company to let them know that my kit didn't include the charging cord. It was the weekend and to my surprise they quickly responded back apologizing and assured me they would take care of the problem. I provided them some basic information and two days later I received a brand new complete kit delivered to my door. It's hard to find that kind of excellent customer service now a days.

I will probably buy another for my mother and am thinking of cutting one up into smaller pieces for face, elbows, etc.  I don't see how anyone could say these are too rough - you decide how much scrubbing you do and how harshly you scrub.

I was able to create a thicker brow with a feathered look. I was shocked at how good the product worked.

It fits on my Revlon 1875 Infrared, which has a notoriously weirdly-shaped barrel, and actually does a good job diffusing, almost surprisingly so. Obviously you'll have to handle it a bit more gingerly than a normal, non-collapsing diffuser, but for the price - and for not having to take up precious suitcase space - I'll deal. Would I go insane if this was my daily use diffuser? Probably, but for the purpose of using it a few times a year while traveling, it'll do just fine.";50.0119569686878

Then I saw this one review mentioning that it doesn't work on thick hair.  But I thought there were thousands of good reviews, and at least majority of those would be true.  So I ordered it to give it a try.  I have thick hair, and let me say that it works great on mine!  It suds up nicely, and has the best aroma I have ever smelled (not too strong, but memorable).  If your hair is dirty and greasy, it works better if you put a little bit of shampoo and wash/rinse quickly first before putting more for a more thorough wash.  I think I am convinced and might be one of those lifers for the product from now on.  If you are like me, don't want to waste a lot of money on product but still want something of good quality, give this product a try.  Oh, I didn't get it for free.;49.99913147164157

With a lifetime of limp fine hair I am used to many products adding weight and bogging it down, not this shampoo. I am without doubt that this had something to do with it as it was the only thing I changed or added during a length of time.

I also have little acne bumps on my chest that seem to be sloughing away with this. They are a little abrasive, but it feels like just the right roughness once you start scrubbing. The length is very nice for back scrubbing. i cant wait to use these in the summer to remove suntan oil and sunscreen! Could also be good for pre-sunless tanning exfoliating - easy to get in between toes and fingers!<br /><br />Cons - abrasive enough that daily use might be too harsh for skin. when scrubbing arms and chest, the material is a bit much for one had. I guess not really a con, but a learning curve since poofs fit conveniently in one hand.<br /><br />An idea - if anyone is crafty, these would make awesome poofs!just some looping and tying or required. posh gift idea!;49.9265526293443
5;1815;0;1;All Beauty;3.467014014404047e-13;1;0.9969;I have been using the pure body naturals shampoo for two days, I have shampooed three times and have to say I am in love with this product.<br />First off, the pump makes dispensing the shampoo easier & it's an effective way to measure out how much liquid you need for one shampoo. I have medium length thicker hair and I use about a pump and a half.<br />My hair has been damaged over the years with use of many products and dyes. I blow dry and straighten my hair every day & there are times where I use a curling Iron as well. Needless to say my hair can feel quite dead at the ends and very frizzy. There is an element to this shampoo called botanical keratin which helps tame the frizzyness.<br />The vitamin D and jojoba in the shampoo also have given my hair incredible shine WITHOUT making it appear greasy!<br />If you have a dry scalp this shampoo will also help you, make sure when you are applying the product you start at your scalp, always give your scalp a good massage, it will stimulate your hair follicles to promote growth and if you have a dry scalp the Argan will help with that!<br />I would love & can't wait to try the conditioning oils. However I didn't even need to use a conditioner with this product. There are vitamins A, B(1&2), E & D, which I believe are the reason why my hair felt so brand new and de-tangled.<br />The scent on this product is heavenly. It's like your shower has been overtaken by a spa & you're not only getting an amazing shampoo you are getting the effects mentally of aromatherapy. The vanilla and honey is such a perfect combination. It's so light and airy yet with the steam of a shower it's just enough to make you feel a great start to the day.<br /><br />I recommend this product 100 percent.<br />*i received this product discounted for an unbiased reveiw;49.92250000001041

5;965;0;1;All Beauty;0.003974674186084996;1;0.9894499999999999;I am totally in love with Argan oil and this product is no exception. The shampoo is very thick and it takes very small amount to shampoo for your entire head. It smells absolutely wonderful. After several weeks of use my hair feels clean and manageable with a huge difference in the amount of frizz. My hair is very soft to the touch with no tangles. I have very naturally curly hair with generally a lot of frizz and out of control. This shampoo has definitely helped with the manageability and calmed down the curls. I have stop to using all styling gel and mousses. I use this shampoo and then apply some argon oil afterwards. My hair is soft and shiny with less product and it feels healthy. I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone. I am very please with the purchase of this product and will definitely be purchasing it again in the future.<br /><br />I did receive a discount on the purchase of this product. This is my honest and biased opinion.;49.85549022558255
5;1332;0;1;All Beauty;1.653196287427534e-06;1;0.9936;I've only had these for a few weeks, but they are AWESOME.<br /><br />Like a couple people mentioned, if you have Keratosis Pilaris this is a godsend. Just make sure you use the proper soap to avoid clogging the hair follicles once they're opened. I'm not sure about the rarer forms, but if you have the common form with bumps, this is going to help. Use a moisturizer after that won't clog the little pores you just clearer up, and over a few weeks you'll see massive improvement. I'm hoping by summer mine is invisible, but honestly this is the clearest I've ever seen my thighs so I am still ecstatic.<br /><br />And, even if you don't have this wretched disease, using this daily followed by coconut oil afterwards will leave you with the smoothest, softest skin you have had since infancy. Ladies of all ages can once again have baby soft skin, as creepy as that sounds. And, like regular washcloths, they can be washed and reused over and over. They also dry almost instantly (whip it and the water just flies off)<br /><br />There are some sellers that are selling fake versions cheaper, but they HURT. These are the real deal. I ended up giving one to my mom and one to my friend because I just want all of womankind to comprehend their utter superiority of other washcloths. I'll be ordering more to throw at my loved ones.;49.84004959588862

5;1153;0;1;All Beauty;0.00011221291102183931;1;0.9907;Works well. Stays on for about a week for me. I do exfoliate my face often and my skin is very oily so it may stay on longer for others. The only thing I don’t like about it is how it stains my enlarged pores so sometimes I’ll see tiny black dots on my eyebrows, not really a big deal and can’t really be seen unless you’re up close and staring. Overall the product works great! I love using it when I have a bunch of events lined up within a week and I may not have the time to fill in my brows. There is really no need to retouch with makeup after the first applicant. I literally have very thin eyebrow hair and after a single 3-4 minute application it creates such a beautiful dark tint. As the week goes by, I do slowly apply some eyebrow makeup just lightly to touch up by this point the pigment is starting to fade. The mixing process is very simple instructions are straightforward. The eyebrow applicator that comes with it works good. If you want to be very precise you may want to use your own thinner eyebrow applicator. I use my own for the ends of my eyebrow where the lines are much thinner. Thank you! Hope this review helps some of you!;49.770866387330656
5;1023;0;1;All Beauty;0.0014530180091660754;1;0.98865;I am a fan.<br /><br />I am one that likes to avoid shampooing my very long, thick and curly hair, usually just sticking to conditioning. I decided to give this a try as a discounted sample. It arrived on a very cold day and it was very thick to the point I thought the pump might be broken. As it turns out, it really does have a high oil content that solidifies in the cold, as olive and coconut will do.<br />I was happy to see it was not creating tons of lather but was freshening up my hair and rinsing it clean. I followed with an argan oil deep conditioner and then brushed out. Without even a leave in and no product, my hair is fairly smooth with great shine and looks healthy. I have a bit of frizz but very little considering no products I usually have to use to tame, presentable even without them.<br />It has a clean scent that isn't coming across as a chemical creation at the Glade air freshener lab but soft and natural. My 8 year old son was laying next to me and told me my hair smelled good, he's a fan.;49.759840540274986

In addition to the oils, there are some other chemicals like Cocamidopropyl betaine which is a surfactant and foaming agent. That doesn't matter to the average person (only matters to someone with serious allergies and dermatitis) and there are less surfactants and similar ingredients than the average shampoo found at Walmart which is good.<br /><br />I'm very happy with what it's done to my son's bleached and dyed hair, and to my own dry brittle hair as well.<br /><br />I received this free in return for my review.";49.66075868669556

I ordered one in August 2020, and it's now September 2022 and this thing is still going strong! I have pretty thick hair and like wearing my hair curly quite often (which requires it being damp/wet). Traditional spray bottles were a PAIN and time consuming. One push=1 tiny spray. Ordered this thing and it has been a HUGE game changer! 1 squeeze of this thing is the equivalent of about 5 or more of traditional bottles. It sprays upside down. And 2 years later, it still sprays the same as when I first got it. Nothing has broken and it has not clogged. And I always fill my bottle with regular tap water. I've even put a little bit of hair product in with it on multiple occasions and it has not affected the performance.;49.63727745220298

Here is what I have learned:<br />1. It can stain your counters/sink. Put a towel or rag down. If you do get it on your counters clean immediately. Soft scrub works well!<br />2. It doesn’t stain your skin. Don’t worry about trying to be neat about it and being detailed to your eye brow. Just slap that crap all over and set your phone timer for however long you want for how dark you want (I prefer 3 mins for a dark brown)<br />3. Set up. Mixing in that little bowl can be messy. I like to use a Q tip to slowly mix it. This way it does not get everywhere on my brush and I make sure I don’t leave any unmixed powder on my brush when I apply to my face.<br />4. Clean up. Cleaning that bowl again don’t want to get on the counters when you have extra left in the bowl. I use a baby wipe to get the extra out before rinsing the bowl and brush.

Unfirtunately you need a LOT of shampoo to cover your head. I have never had to use so much shampoo to wash my hair. It seems really watered down and doesnt lather at all. The. Washing it out my hair feels so dry whish is odd since its got argan oil in the shampoo. Then using the conditioner softens it a little bit. But honestly i can use Garnier which is 1/3 the cost and the a better result also i can use much less.

Mine are translucent pastel colors (some light gray and white). Didn't really care either way, however. These are so much better than traditional jawclips in terms of getting a grab on your hair. These clips are intended for hair-styling purposes more so than using IN a hairstyle if you get what I mean. I probably wouldn't wear one out-and-about but I do use them for sectioning off my hair when I'm blow-drying, curling, or straightening it. Also nice for using to get hair away from face while applying makeup or washing your face. The &#34;grip&#34; power these have on your hair is like nothing I've ever had in a hair clip. The word &#34;clamp&#34; in the product title is accurate. These do not budge  or shift, even in straight hair. They really lock your hair in, I think the triangular nature of the teeth on the clips has something to do with that.

I also used eyebrow stencils to guide me as I proceeded to dye my brows. I left it on for two minutes then I wiped it off and there they were, brows! But they got better as the next couple of minutes past because it seems to continue to darken for a minute or two. No allergic reaction either which is a blessing because I am alergic to just about everything!

Not to mention that on European travel, finding an adapter for a hair dryer is difficult. A friend recommended I buy a travel diffuser. I gave it a whirl with this one. I am SO happy that I did. This diffuser is made with a pliable rubber that allows it to collapse relatively flat. It fits all of the hair dryers that I have used it on in Belgium and Amsterdam. Some are tougher to get on than others, but by warming up the neck with the hair dryer, it makes it a bit easier.<br /><br />I did read some complaints about the diffuser collapsing while in use. This can happen, but it doesn't bother me. You just cannot expect to slam it on your head and expect it to stay out.

I swear I can hear the grime, dirt, and dead skin crying as I scrub them away.<br />This will work on the smelliest, nastiest, dirtiest person EVER. It has very powerful scrubbing action. However, at the same time it doesn’t feel too rough or painful.<br />If there are any people in this world you should take advice or products for in terms of bathing it is the JAPANESE. They know their stuff and they know the best way to get clean, I say this as a half Japanese person.<br />The price is cheap, the colors are nice, the durability is amazing, it dries fairly quickly, and it just works.<br />The only con I would say is the size. I know that it’s meant for scrubbing all over your body and particularly the hard to reach back, but it can sometimes be a bother when it comes to drying since it takes up a bit of space. However, it works to reach all the nooks and crannies so I can’t complain.<br />Also make sure to get the authentic one which is made in Japan (not China) and it is made of real salux.<br />After using this I don’t think I could ever go back to using any other scrubber.

And it is such a drag filling them in every day. With this kit I am able to wear my eyebrows by themselves if I please, or I can fill them in a little on the arch in much much less time that it would normally take to craft a perfect eyebrow from scratch.<br /><br />The amount of color powder per capsule is way more than you need for one application. I only need a little &#34;spoonful&#34;, grabbed with the edge of the included angled applicator brush, for 2 back-to-back applications to my eyebrows (I apply twice for a more intense result).  What I do is I take a contact lens case, and break one capsule into one side of  the case--then I transfer what I need into the other side, and mix a bit of developer. This way you can make your kit last much much longer!

It gives a good mist in one spray and evenly damps my hair once I am finished. I would have liked to mix my conditioner, water, and oil together in it. But the manual doesn't recommend it. Stating that it may clog the spray. This limits what I truly need the bottle for. As a result, to pay that much just to spray water doesn't seem to worth it.

This lasts for a few days. With the cleansing, moisturizers, and oils I use and that my face produces, the tint does not last as long as I would like. Since I only use it for my brows, I don’t mix the whole capsule, just tapping out a few sprinklings at a time. It’s pretty easy, just  use the same ratio (I eyeball it) for both the powder and activator. Please pay attention to how long you keep it on. I accidentally forgot once and left the tint on for over 30 minutes. Looked like a grouch. But it’s forgiving.

But, different brands use different price points that may not be entirely justified.<br /><br />Relative to the other similar to nearly identical products, this one was priced at the low-end.  And, I give it credit for that.  I wasted less money upfront than I would have with the other ones.  But, I suspect the results would be identical.;36.52758207693038

After just 5-7 minutes I would have beautiful dark brown brows. The recent order I purchased must have been a different formula. The first time I dye my brows, I waited my usual 5-7 minutes and the color hardly changed at all. It was probably a dark blonde color at best. I applied the dye again and waited another 10 minutes this time and they were just a little darker, maybe a light brown color. I thought maybe it was just a fluke so I tried again this week and I got the same results. Even after leaving the dye on my eyebrows for 20+ minutes they didn't get any darker than a light brown.

Also be cautious that this product contains p-phenylenediamine or PPD which is a common contact allergen that causes many people to have an allergic reaction. It’s not exactly safe to use on skin, and is typically used in hair dye. I was fine, but be sure to do a patch test beforehand.

I thought it would be a lot smaller, so thank you for this big bottle. I have a lot of hair, thick, coarse, very curly hair. It is dry and damaged so I really needed to give it life back. After trying so many different hair products I still have not found something that really helps my hair. Now I have only tried this shampoo for two days now but so far I am very pleased. I do have to use a lot to cover all of the hair more then the dime size recommendation. After rinsing it out my hair did feel softer and smoother but I can still feel all the things wrong with it. Even though I have high hopes for this, I do not like the smell at all. I am considering adding my essential oils to make it smell better but we shall see. I am really hoping after I use this more that it will help my hair feel better and become healthier.

I have used this shampoo a couple of times and I really like it. I usually was every other day, so my hair doesn't get to oily or greasy feeling. This works wonders at getting my scalp nice and clean and leaving my hair feel super soft. I use this shampoo to mainly focus on my scalp and really work it in there and let the suds rinse through the rest so my ends don't get as dry and then I use a Argan Oil hair mask for my ends to help them keep moisture and not dry out. I think I have found a good combination for now that will work for my hair, but alas my hair constantly changes with what works for it. If your looking for something to help your hair this would be a good option to try. I did receive a discount for my fair, honest and unbiased opinion of this product.;34.86231934042075
2;1137;0;1;All Beauty;0.00015733826754873838;0;0.9941;I’m changing my original review which I’m keeping below because I’ve just ordered this product for the 11th time. It was unavailable for a while but once it was back in stock I ordered and they’ve changed the exact same product to an 8oz bottle. The bottle in my shower of the exact same item I’ve purchased 10 times before is 16oz. Same price, half the product. And when I went back to my history, the item description is the current size of 8oz. I would have been fine with a price hike on the product, but the same price for half the product? It’s a great product. But at double the price I just can’t. They should have introduced a new item at that size, not change the existing one to a smaller size. Very disappointed. Original review below.<br /><br />I can't even begin to explain how amazing this makes my hair feels. I was even getting a facial, and the aestitician made a comment about how soft and wonderful my hair was. All the oils leave your hair nourished and soft without making it oily. I'm so happy I happened upon this shampoo. Plus I like that it's made up of more natural ingredients. That's always important to me.;34.857220148026464
4;1788;0;1;All Beauty;9.552531605297848e-13;0;0.994;I love this eyebrow tint! First off, I want to say that I believe it's meant to tint the skin. Whether or not it is meant for that, it does that. I'm one that likes to fill in my eyebrows to some degree everyday even if I'm wearing no makeup. On lighter days, I'll just throw an eyebrow gel in there to add some darkness. Since I use this to tint the skin, after mixing equal parts powder and developer (may take a few times to know if you got it right or not),I use an angled eyebrow brush and fill them in as I would normally. This can be difficult if you're not used to doing this. It's important not to mess up since it will stain! I just keep a pointed q-tip on hand to clean away any mistakes and that works great for me. I fill out the ends first and work my way towards the center of the face. I only use what's leftover on the brush for the inside portion. I wait for 8-10 minutes and then wipe off with a makeup remover wipe. Most of the time, I do it twice (one time after the other) to get the color I want, since I don't want to overdo it. For reference, I am Asian with dark dark brown almost black hair. I'm sure if you have lighter hair, you'd do it for much shorter. I just experimented with it. I'll also note that it does nothing to actually tint my hairs, which is why I use it the way I do. I tried leaving it on for longer to achieve a darker color and that was a bad idea! I left it on for 20 minutes and it got all splotchy and patchy. I found that doing the two rounds of 10 minutes worked best for me. It also lasts only up to 5 days, which is disappointing, but still okay. That's why I rated this 4 stars - I wish it lasted longer. Overall, it looks great and is a very natural color while still making me look put together with nicely shaped brows. Love this!;34.85000000002866

4;1720;0;1;All Beauty;1.1313776200065328e-11;0;0.9874;First let me say:  READ my review CAREFULLY to avoid an eyebrow malfunction like I experienced.  Second, the tint works great!!  Third, I’m grateful for the bike chain degreaser I still had hibernating in my cupboard, 20 years later.  Read on:<br /><br />I tinted my eyebrows thinking that it was OK to get some on the skin above and below my eyebrows and that it would wash off easily.  After all, when I self-color my hair, the excess color wipes off my skin with no problem!!  Ya, nope not true of this eyebrow tint.  The excess wouldn’t come off!!!  In hindsight, I had a very Low IQ moment.  The instructions do tell you to test a patch of your skin before using it on your eyebrows.  I didn’t do that.  You should!!<br /><br />After I washed the tint off and attempted to wash the excess tint off, I saw a female Groucho Marx in the mirror. I tried removing the excess tint with 3 different face soaps, then regular body wash soap, then baking soda, then toothpaste.<br /><br />Tier 2:  Shout with bleach, Comet spray w/bleach.  Then Lysol wipes... moved onto nail polish remover.  Then hairspray.  But what actually did it was the 🚲 bike degreaser I use on my bike chain.  Thank goodness because I was about ready to just dump an entire Costco-sized bottle of bleach on my face and let a higher power step in!!<br /><br />Worth noting:  it was an eyebrow tint product  from Slovenia so it probably doesn’t have the same ease of removal standards as American hair color products!<br /><br />Great product but just be very careful not to overdo it and don’t get it on the skin near your eyebrows!!  Aim carefully at JUST your eyebrows!!<br /><br />PS.  I am sparing you a picture of my mishap...you’re welcome!!  😊🤣;34.685000000339414

3;672;0;1;All Beauty;0.17731987039779637;0;0.73335;After buying a new blowdryer, I immediately threw away the diffuser that came with it, because I NEVER used one and have shorter hair, only to realize about a month later that I wanted to try using one on my hair that I have been growing out for over a year now. I have only used this a few times now, but it doesn't fit great on my blowdryer - I really have to cram it on. It also tends to fold on itself and droop as I'm using it, most likely from the heat making it soft and because the wide top is a little heavy compared to the soft rubbery body. It does fold down nice and flat for storage.<br /><br />It's an OK tool, especially for something I don't use every day.;33.65334611193389

I purchased this collapsible diffuser to use exclusively with my travel blow dryer (https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV22/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2?th=1) when traveling, and have used it a few times now. Overall, it works like it's supposed to and takes up a lot less space compared to my every-day diffuser. Some other reviewers commented about the tight fit when putting the diffuser on. I also had a hard time with this, but once it was on there wasn't a problem. Other commenters also mentioned the diffuser collapsing. I didn't have a problem with this, but I tend to hold the diffuser and not the dryer while I'm drying my hair. However, it isn't sturdy enough to lift my hair at the roots like my every-day, non-collapsible diffuser is. Pros: compact design (collapses to about an inch); light; easy to remove from dryer and collapse; diffuses the air like it's supposed to.<br /><br />Cons: a little hard to fit over the dryer nozzle; not as sturdy compared to non-collapsible diffusers; not strong enough to lift the hair at the roots for drying.";33.373743992894006

If you have very sparse eyebrows though i.e. areas where there is really no hair, the dye will not last more than 3-4 days because it is on skin. If you have a little hair, then no worries-  dye will probably last for a week at least (6 weeks HIGHLY unlikely). Have also tried a similar creme product and although the convenience was great, it wouldn't activate and stain well (and yes I used chemical i.e. peroxide gel/creme as specified). The powder capsules can be opened and used in smaller amounts since you won't need a full capsule for each use, so this is a very economical buy. Carefully open the capsule, place the powder in the included grey cap, or on one end of a plastic soup spoon (easier to clean) and mix with the creme. That's how little you need.";32.71523972185061

She has learned to put it on by sliding it from the front of her forehead instead of sitting it on the top of her head and pushing down........she doesn't have it on for long but it's a fun toy......  It came in a little plastic container, (flimsy but served the purpose), so no worries about it getting bent during transit and it came with a couple of replacement stones for the 'more serious wearer'.<br />Update:  This is still as cute as ever but we've had to gorilla glue/clothes pin it twice.......she hasn't been rough with it and hasn't bent it.....it just breaks and comes off the band....maybe they should have soldered it in a few more places or something.

More often than not when the mixture dries the shape doesn't look as clean and crisp as one would hope.<br /><br />2) Gradients are difficult so getting that even gradual change in intensity from the beginning to end of the brow is really hard.<br /><br />3) The tint only lasts 2-3 days for me. It may be different for other people but for me it only lasts that long. I can't really complain too much about that though considering normally filling in my eyebrows would be otherwise be a daily process....BUT considering I get a better looking finish when I revert to my former method of filling in my eyebrows daily with an eyebrow pencil, I've decided toddle with the tedious daily process and leave Godefroy alone.;29.472842368880777

I usually blow dry it straight after a wash and it lasts for several days before I need to wash it again.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Smells nice. Smells like the essential oils. It's very subtle, not perfumey at all, and really I can't even smell it after my hair is dry.<br />- Gentle. It does not irritate my scalp<br />- Cleared up my dandruff/scalp rash from my previous shampoo that irritated my scalp and I was always itchy.<br />- Cleans well. Some natural shampoos don't seem to remove all natural oils or hair products, but this one does.<br />- Even without conditioner, I can get a comb through my hair. Not something I can say about most shampoos.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Still need conditioner. I thought with all the oils are nourishing that I wouldn't need a conditioner, but I do.<br />- My hair gets oily faster. When using this, I need to wash my hair more often. I used to get 4 days out of wash and now I barely get two since switching to this.<br />- My hair is extremely static-y! It doesn't matter how much conditioner, leave-ins or serums I apply, I cannot get the static to go away. I didn't have this problem before this shampoo.<br />- Price. It doesn't do anything for me that I can't get from a cheaper shampoo.<br /><br />OVERALL: The fact that may hair gets greasy fast and and that it's so static-y tells me my hair is too dry. I need a moisturizing shampoo. When my hair/scalp is properly moisturized, it doesn't get greasy and I don't get flyaways. I thought this was a moisturizing shampoo with all the oils in it, but I guess they all just get rinsed away, and then some. I will not buy this again because I cannot stand static-y hair.;23.71250000003716

I will say the push thing to get the shampoo did not work for a week or two then suddenly worked. Not sure why or what happened but during the time it didn't work it was very difficult to get the shampoo out due to the inflexible plastic of the container making it impossible to squeeze it out. But now it works and I'm good to go. I did receives discount for my opinion which was unfavorable when it was broken but not it is favorable.;23.094756840569968
